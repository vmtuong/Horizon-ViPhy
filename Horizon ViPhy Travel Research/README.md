Aether's Notebook Android Client
=========

About
-----

Aether's Notebook is a client-server logging framework.  This is the Android
client version.  It consists of two features, a library for logging data and
an application for controlling the logging.  Several built in loggers are 
included for logging information from the Android wireless sensors (e.g. 3G
connectivity) as well as a file appender for recording log information.

Future versions will expose hooks to allow extra appenders and loggers to be 
inserted easily into the system.
